  Name: Ayam Cemani
  Description: "Mysterious, sleek, and dressed head-to-toe in black \u2014 the Ayam
    Cemani is the shadowy legend of the chicken world. Not only are its feathers
    a deep, shimmering black, but so are its skin, beak, comb, tongue, and even its
    internal organs. It\u2019s the goth icon of the coop. Despite the dramatic appearance,
    Cemani chickens are surprisingly calm and gentle. They tend to be quiet and composed,
    moving through the flock like silent guardians. While they\u2019re not the most
    productive egg layers, they more than make up for it with their unforgettable
    presence. Originating in Indonesia, the Ayam Cemani has long been associated
    with spiritual rituals and local legends. Some believe it brings power, protection,
    or even good luck. Whether or not that\u2019s true, one thing\u2019s for sure
    \u2014 this bird feels like it has secrets. In your game, Ayam Cemani adds mystery
    and elegance. She\u2019s the dark horse of your flock (well, chicken), and her
    mere existence raises your coop\u2019s cool factor by at least 200%. Just...
    don\u2019t ask what she\u2019s planning. "
