  Name: Polish Crest
  Description: "With a head full of wild feathers that looks more like a fluffy wig
    than a hairstyle, the Polish Crest is one of the most eye-catching chickens around.
    Its massive, poofy crest often covers its eyes entirely, giving it a perpetually
    surprised \u2014 or slightly confused \u2014 expression. Despite their dramatic
    looks, Polish chickens are actually quite sweet and gentle. They\u2019re curious
    and social, but their limited vision can make them a bit jumpy or clumsy. It\u2019s
    not uncommon to see one bump into a fence post or mistake a feather for a snack.
    But hey \u2014 style comes at a cost. This breed has been around for centuries,
    with roots tracing back to Europe. They were especially popular in royal courts
    and art, admired more for their looks than their eggs. With that iconic crest,
    it\u2019s easy to see why they were considered living decorations. In your game,
    Polish Crest brings flair, fashion, and a little chaos. She might not see where
    she\u2019s going, but she\u2019s absolutely strutting there in style. Every coop
    needs a drama queen \u2014 and this one wears her crown proudly. "
