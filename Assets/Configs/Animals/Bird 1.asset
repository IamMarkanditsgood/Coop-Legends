  Name: Brahma Giant
  Description: "The Brahma is a true heavyweight in the chicken world \u2014 tall,
    broad, and covered in thick, feathery fluff that makes it look even bigger. With
    feathered legs and a slow, regal walk, the Brahma carries itself like the monarch
    of the barnyard. Don\u2019t let the size fool you though \u2014 this gentle giant
    is all about peace. Known for their calm and patient nature, Brahmas are surprisingly
    friendly and easygoing. They don\u2019t mind being picked up (if you can lift
    them!) and rarely cause trouble. If your coop had a sofa, the Brahma would be
    lounging on it with a cup of tea, nodding wisely at the chaos around her. Originally
    bred in the U.S. from chickens with roots in India and China, the Brahma was
    once considered the king of meat birds in the 19th century. Some even reached
    up to 12 pounds! Today, they\u2019re more often raised for show, companionship,
    or simply because they\u2019re so darn impressive. In your game, Brahma Giant
    brings big energy, slow strides, and a very chill vibe. She may not be fast,
    but every egg she lays feels like a royal gift. Think of her as the matriarch
    of your growing flock. "
