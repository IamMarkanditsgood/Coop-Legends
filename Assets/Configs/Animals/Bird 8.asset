  Name: Hamburg Speckle
  Description: "Dressed in a fancy speckled coat and strutting like she\u2019s late
    for a village parade, Hamburg Speckle is a true barnyard fashionista. With crisp
    white feathers dotted in neat black spots, she always looks like she\u2019s been
    sprinkled with confetti \u2014 and she acts like it too. Hamburgs are energetic,
    elegant, and a bit high-maintenance. They love to stay busy, often darting around
    the coop in search of bugs or drama. They're not exactly cuddle fans, but they
    do love attention \u2014 as long as you admire them from the correct angle. The
    breed hails from Europe, with a history going back hundreds of years. Known as
    one of the oldest show breeds, Hamburgs have long been prized for their beauty,
    alertness, and consistent egg-laying. They're like aristocrats who also happen
    to be productive. In your game, Hamburg Speckle brings class, speed, and sparkle.
    She\u2019s not just here to lay eggs \u2014 she\u2019s here to make an entrance.
    One flap of her wings, and the whole coop knows she\u2019s arrived."
