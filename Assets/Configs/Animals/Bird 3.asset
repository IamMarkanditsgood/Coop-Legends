  Name: Sebright Spark
  Description: "Tiny, shiny, and full of energy \u2014 the Sebright Spark is like
    a walking piece of jewelry with wings. With striking laced feathers that look
    hand-drawn in black ink, this bantam breed turns heads wherever she struts. She\u2019s
    small, but her attitude? Huge. Sebrights are bold and curious, often acting like
    they\u2019re twice their actual size. They zip around the coop like they own
    the place and aren\u2019t afraid to confront chickens five times their weight.
    Full of confidence and charm, they\u2019re natural attention-seekers \u2014 and
    honestly, they deserve it. This glamorous breed was created in England in the
    early 1800s by Sir John Sebright, who wanted a chicken that looked elegant and
    ornamental. Mission accomplished: the Sebright remains one of the most stylish
    and unique-looking birds in the poultry world. In your game, Sebright Spark adds
    sparkle and sass. She doesn\u2019t lay many eggs, but she brings drama, confidence,
    and serious main-character energy. Think of her as the glitter in your chicken
    empire. "
