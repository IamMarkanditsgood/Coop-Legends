  Name: Cochin Puff
  Description: "Round, fluffy, and slower than a nap in the sun \u2014 Cochin Puff
    is basically a feather-covered pillow with legs. This gentle giant waddles around
    with an air of calm wisdom, looking like she\u2019s wearing a ballgown made of
    feathers. And yes, she\u2019s just as soft as she looks. Cochins are beloved
    for their docile nature and cuddly appearance. They\u2019re not in a hurry \u2014
    ever. Instead, they prefer to take their time, sit in cozy corners, and occasionally
    bless the world with an egg or two. They\u2019re the queens of comfort and are
    often the first to settle in for a good long sit. Originally from China, Cochins
    gained popularity in Europe and America during the 19th century \u201Chen craze\u201D
    thanks to their sheer fluffiness and novelty. They\u2019re often raised more
    for companionship and looks than for egg production. In your game, Cochin Puff
    brings tranquility and volume \u2014 of feathers, that is. She\u2019s not the
    fastest or the flashiest, but she\u2019s definitely the coziest. A living beanbag
    chair, and proud of it. "
