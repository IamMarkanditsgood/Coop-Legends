  Name: Orpington Goldie
  Description: "Warm, golden, and full of charm \u2014 Orpington Goldie is the sunbeam
    of the coop. With her soft, buff-colored feathers and gentle expression, she
    brings calm wherever she waddles. She\u2019s the kind of chicken who\u2019d bake
    cookies if she had thumbs. Orpingtons are known for being affectionate, friendly,
    and easygoing. They love human attention, don\u2019t mind being held, and are
    often the first to greet you at the gate. Goldie might not be the fastest or
    the boldest, but she\u2019s always kind \u2014 and surprisingly clever. This
    breed was developed in England in the late 1800s to be both a good layer and
    a cold-hardy companion. Orpingtons quickly became popular for their reliable
    egg production, fluffy looks, and excellent parenting instincts. In your game,
    Orpington Goldie is the heart of the flock. She\u2019s reliable, graceful, and
    always there to brighten your farm\u2019s day. Every coop needs a little gold
    \u2014 and she\u2019s worth her weight in sunshine. "
