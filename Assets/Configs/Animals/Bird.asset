  Name: Silkie Fluff
  Description: "At first glance, the Silkie looks more like a fuzzy pom-pom than
    a chicken. Its feathers are so soft and fine that they feel like silk or cotton
    candy \u2014 hence the name. Fluff covers its entire body, even its legs! And
    under all that softness? Jet-black skin and bones. Yep, this bird is black inside,
    but don\u2019t worry \u2014 she\u2019s a total sweetheart. Silkies are famous
    for their calm and cuddly personalities. Many people keep them as pets or show
    birds, and they\u2019re especially popular with kids. They\u2019re not great
    at flying, but they are excellent mothers \u2014 they\u2019ll even raise other
    chickens\u2019 babies if you let them! The breed originated in China, where it
    was once believed to have magical properties. In ancient times, people thought
    Silkie meat could boost health and even extend life. Some legends claimed they
    were connected to the spirit world thanks to their mystical appearance. In your
    coop, Silkie Fluff is a symbol of pure coziness and gentle chaos. She might not
    be the most productive chicken, but she\u2019s definitely the fluffiest. Don\u2019t
    be surprised if you find yourself building her a tiny couch in the henhouse. "
