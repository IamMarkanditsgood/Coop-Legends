  Name: Frizzle Dizzy
  Description: "Meet the feather tornado known as Frizzle Dizzy \u2014 a chicken
    who looks like she stuck her beak in a hair dryer and loved it. With feathers
    that curl outward instead of lying flat, she\u2019s got the wildest hairdo in
    the flock, and she rocks it with pride. Frizzles are known for their quirky appearance
    and equally quirky personalities. They tend to be gentle and friendly, though
    they might not be the most graceful. Strong winds? Light rain? Forget it. This
    bird isn\u2019t built for stealth or speed \u2014 she\u2019s all about flair
    and flounce. The frizzle gene can appear in several chicken breeds, but when
    it takes over fully, you get a bird that looks like it\u2019s perpetually having
    a bad feather day \u2014 in the best way. People love them for their uniqueness
    and show-worthy style. In your game, Frizzle Dizzy adds chaotic charm and maximum
    volume. She may look like she just survived a tornado, but she\u2019s happy,
    huggable, and impossible to ignore. Every coop needs a little fabulous mess \u2014
    and she\u2019s it. "
