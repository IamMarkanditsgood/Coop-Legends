  Name: Leghorn Zoomer
  Description: "Fast, feisty, and always on the move \u2014 the Leghorn Zoomer is
    the ultimate egg-laying machine with energy to spare. With her sleek white feathers
    and bright yellow legs, she zips around the farm like she\u2019s late for something
    important (probably egg business). Leghorns are known for their incredible productivity.
    These birds can lay over 300 eggs a year \u2014 they basically treat egg-laying
    like a competitive sport. They're alert, independent, and not too fond of cuddles,
    but they\u2019ll keep your egg counters full and your coop lively. Originally
    from Italy, the Leghorn became a global superstar in the poultry world thanks
    to her hardworking nature and adaptability. If she had a motto, it\u2019d be
    \u201CLess talk, more eggs.\u201D She\u2019s a little noisy, a little wild, and
    completely unstoppable. In your game, Leghorn Zoomer brings speed and serious
    output. She\u2019s not here to make friends \u2014 she\u2019s here to break records.
    Expect chaos, clucks, and a whole lot of eggs. "
